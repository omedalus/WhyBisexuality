Sexuality improves adaption to more complex environments:

Discussion content:
 	The HSH is one explination for the evolution of haploid-diploid (cite), but it fails to stand up to evidence (cite next two):
"The haploid susceptibility hypothesis (HSH) was proposed as an explanation for how behavioral roles in haplodiploid social systems evolved. It posits that haploid males are more susceptible to disease than diploid females due to decreased genetic variability at key disease resistance loci. The resulting decreased immunocompetence is hypothesized to have played a role in the evolution of social behavior by limiting the behavioral repertoire haploids perform..." Results of this study DO NOT support the HSH:

These results also DO NOT support the HSH:
