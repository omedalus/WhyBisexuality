## An exploration of the evolution of multiple sexes in sexual reproduction

Forked from Paul's WhyBisexuality in order to migrate to Angular 5.0.

### Summary

Sexual reproduction has well-known advantages over its more primitive asexual equivalent, but the evolution of multiple sexes broaches a paradox of irreducibility. We ask whether having two or more gamete types confers an advantage over a hypothetical single-gamete reproductive strategy. In the context of proposing an answer to this question, we note that many species have one sex that is effectively haploid in at least one chromosome (the sex chromosome, naturally). We therefore hypothesize that having a two-sex population in which one sex is (at least partially) haploid and the other diploid, and the two sexes can only breed with one another, performs better than a single-sex species in which any individual can mate with any other; and, furthermore, that the reason for this improved performance involves an emergent "beam search" pattern in which the haploid sex experiments with new "features" while the diploid sex retains the best feature set found thus far. This project runs a model that tests this hypothesis.

It's been long established that sexual reproduction is advantageous to a species because it shuffles the species' genome, conferring rapid adaptation to new survival pressures. However, by itself, this principle doesn't addre

Discussion content:
 	The HSH is one explination for the evolution of haploid-diploid (cite), but it fails to stand up to evidence (cite next two):
"The haploid susceptibility hypothesis (HSH) was proposed as an explanation for how behavioral roles in haplodiploid social systems evolved. It posits that haploid males are more susceptible to disease than diploid females due to decreased genetic variability at key disease resistance loci. The resulting decreased immunocompetence is hypothesized to have played a role in the evolution of social behavior by limiting the behavioral repertoire haploids perform..." Results of this study DO NOT support the HSH:

These results also DO NOT support the HSH:
